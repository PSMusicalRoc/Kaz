# The Kazuya Experience

Kazuya Mishima, Wins.

## Changes
- Kazuya now has input assist from Tekken. By holding down Shield + Special and flicking a direction on the control stick, you can input some of Kazuya's moves:
  - Shield + Special + Forward: Electric Wind God Fist
  - Shield + Special + Back: Input + B (the spin)
  - Shield + Special + Up: Reflector Kick
  - Shield + Special + Down: Nothing (yet!)
- F Smash is ~10 Frames faster
- Neutral B is faster (idk by how much lol)
- Wind God Fist is now EWGF, and the previous EWGF input now kills like Game and Watch's 9.
- Crouch Dash can be cancelled into from any state in the game, including but not limited to:
  - Your attacks
  - Hitstun
  - Shield Break Animation
  - Crouch Dash
  - Your opponent's throws


Have fun!
